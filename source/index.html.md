# Evil IIIF Presentation Manifests

This is a collection of evil IIIF presentation manifests, each one crafted to break IIIF in some interesting way, or to demonstrate something odd that I wanted to try.

These are used for testing  [IIIF Presentation Manifests](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/).

Manifest Name                              |
-------------------------------------------|-----------
[Base Manifest](/iiif/base.json)           | This one isn't evil.  It's just here so that we have something to compare the rest of them to.
[Data URI Thumbnails](/iiif/data_uri.json) | This one has the thumbnails replaced with inline base64 encoded Data URIs.
